# Sign commits with OIDC and Sigstore

It's important to secure your pipelines, and part of that is verifying who or what made commits. Open ID Connect (OIDC) and Sigstore give you forensic tools to ensure commits that look like they were generated by automation actually were.

Pipelines are sometimes used to create new commits that are pushed back to a Git repositoryâ€“for example: 

- A scheduled build that updates a repository.
- A pipeline that builds a new artifact (like a Docker image) and then triggers a deploy of the new code with a Git commit.

By default, the commits are not cryptographically signed and there's no way to securely link it back to the build or pipeline that generated it. Open ID Connect (OIDC) is ...

Sigstore is ... Sigstore can generate short lifetime (~15 mins) x509 certificates that are suitable for signing artifacts like Docker images and Git commits. The certificates are written to a transparency log, so signatures can be verified as:

1. Created by a particular certificate.
1. Created during the period the certificate was valid.

A common way to use Sigstore is in _keyless_ mode, where the short term certificate is linked to an OIDC token and identity. The OIDC token can identify a human (often an identity from Google, Microsoft or Github), or sometimes a continuous integration (CI) provider like Buildkite.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to sign Git commits using short lifetime [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) x509 certificates.

## Before you start

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- [gitsign](https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign), v0.6.0 or later.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This tutorial uses GitHub, but Buildkite can work with any version control system.

## Write the code

gitsign is a program that uses keyless Sigstore to sign Git commits with an OIDC identity (via a x509 certificate, not gpg). It looks for the `SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN` environment variable. If found, the OIDC token in the value is used as the identity to fetch an x509 certificate and sign the commit.

1. Create a new repo (or fork ours?)
1. Add the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh 

set -e

echo "+++ fetching OIDC token from Buildkite"

# gitsign supports caching credentials, but we don't want to do that. Unset the ENV var if its found
unset GITSIGN_CREDENTIAL_CACHE
SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN="$(buildkite-agent oidc request-token --audience sigstore)"

echo "+++ creating signed git commit"

# setup the working directory git checkout to sign commits

git config --local commit.gpgsign true  # Sign all commits
git config --local tag.gpgsign true  # Sign all tags
git config --local gpg.x509.program gitsign  # Use gitsign for signing
git config --local gpg.format x509  # gitsign expects x509 args

# Create a new commit on a branch and push up to GitHub
BRANCH_NAME="branch-`date +%s`"
git checkout -b ${BRANCH_NAME}
echo `date --iso-8601=seconds` > the-date.txt
git add the-date.txt
git commit the-date.txt -m "update"

echo "+++ pushing branch to github"

git push origin -u ${BRANCH_NAME}
```

1. Add the pipeline definition:

```yaml
steps:
  - command: ".buildkite/steps/change-commit-push"
    label: ":git:"
```


## Create a pipeline

1. In the [Buildkite dashboard](), select ... to create a new pipeline.
1. Link to your repo.
1. Add step to upload the pipeline definition.

## Run a build

On GitHub, you'll see the commit is signed but unverified, because GitHub expects x509 signed commits to use a public Certificate Authority. They don't understand Sigstore:

_IMAGE_

## View the certificate

To print the certificate for a Git commit, use the following command:

```sh
git cat-file commit HEAD | sed -n '/BEGIN/, /END/p' | sed 's/^ //g' | sed 's/gpgsig //g' | sed 's/SIGNED MESSAGE/PKCS7/g' | openssl pkcs7 -print -print_certs -text
```

The output looks like the following:

```sh

You'll notice:

- The subject Alternative Name is the pipeline URL.
- The issuer identity is `https://agent.buildkite.com`.
- The certificate is signed by `sigstore.dev`. This Certificate Authority is NOT one that's trusted by default in any browser or operating system.

## Verify a Buildkite build created a commit

To verify that a commit was created in a specific Buildkite pipeline, use the follow command replacing `YOUR_GITHUB_SOMETHING` with the value for your repository:

```sh
$ gitsign verify --certificate-identity=https://buildkite.com/yob-opensource/oidc-signing-experiment --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://agent.buildkite.com HEAD
```

Notice:

- The pipeline URL as the certificate identity.
- The OIDC issuer is `https://agent.buildkite.com`.

### Expected output

If the sinature is correct, you'll see:

```sh
gitsign: Signature made using certificate ID 0x8cd9e267dcc37c109a5c1f1811ad1608c692465c | CN=sigstore-intermediate,O=sigstore.dev
gitsign: Good signature from [https://buildkite.com/yob-opensource/oidc-signing-experiment](https://agent.buildkite.com)
Validated Git signature: true
Validated Rekor entry: true
Validated Certificate claims: true
```

If the signature is wrong, you'll see:

```sh
Error: none of the expected identities matched what was in the certificate, got subjects [joe@example.com] with issuer https://accounts.google.com
```

If there's no signature, you'll see:

```sh
Error: unsupported signature type
```

## Next steps

That's it! You've created a pipeline that pushes commits signed with OIDC and Sigstore back to a repository. ðŸŽ‰

To continue securing your pipelines, we recommend you learn more about the agent's [oidc command](http://localhost:3000/docs/agent/v3/cli-oidc). Then think about how you could use it to create a hook that restricts an agent to only run commits signed by known users or automation, without trying to pass the identity from the source control system.
